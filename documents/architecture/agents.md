# Agents
The agents of AFIE, and how they will be used.

## **`ProjectScaffolder`** (a.k.a. Initiation Agent)
 * **Type:** Agent with tools
 * **Role:** Runs once to create a minimal, runnable project structure from a genre description.
 * **Input:** Basic description of game from user.
 * **Output:** A complete project directory, "main" file, minimal files needed to create a runnable framework.
 * **Tools:** `EngineDoc`, `EngineAPI`, `EngineCode` RAGs
 * **Instructions:** "Create a minimal Ursina Engine project folder structure and files, including main file, to be used as a starting point for development for the described game project idea."

## **`ProductionManager`**
 * **Type:** Agent with tools
 * **Role:** Interfaces with the human user to discuss and develop the user's idea for a new feature. This agent ensures that the user's feature description is complete and is not a replication of an existing feature before submitting it to the Technical Architect, once the human approved of the feature request description. This agent also classifies whether this is a new feature, an update to an existing feature, or a bugfix.
 * **Input:** Discussion with user.
 * **Output:** Feature request.
 * **Tools:** `FeatureRequestHistory`, `ArchtecturalDecisionRecord`
 * **Instructions:** "Engage in honest and productive discussion with the human user to develop their feature request. You will ask questions as necessary to ensure that the feature request is complete such that the Technical Architect has sufficient information from which to build a FIP. Use the FeatureRequestHistory and ArchitecturalDecisionRecord to ensure that an identical feature has not already been created. Note that the user may wish to make a change or bugfix to an existing feature, in which case context of the existing feature should be referenced. With each round of messages, end the message to the user with a complete description of the feature request, and the question of whether the user approves of the feature request or would like to discuss further. If the request is approved, record the feature request in the FeatureRequestHistory, and pass the feature request to the Technical Architect."

## **`TechnicalArchitect`**
 * **Type:** Agent with tools
 * **Role:** To design technical solutions for new features within the existing codebase.
 * **Input:** Feature request (from the Production Manager)
 * **Output:** FIP (as input to the review committee)
 * **Tools:** `EngineDoc`, `EngineAPI`, `EngineCode`, `ProjectContextManager`, `ADRManager`
 * **Instructions:** "You are a senior Ursina Engine architect. Design a technical plan to implement the user's request by modifying the existing codebase. Consult the engine RAGs, ProjectContextManager, and the project's `ADR` to ensure your design is robust, efficient, and consistent. If a major new pattern is required, draft a new ADR entry."

## **`FeaturePackageValidator`** (a.k.a. Fidelity & Completeness Analyst)
 * **Type:** Agent with tools
 * **Role:** To assess the the FIP for completeness and fidelity, and confirm that what is described in the FIP will fulfill what is requested in the feature request.
 * **Input:** Feature request, FIP
 * **Output:** FIP approval status (PASS | FAIL), suggestions to the Technical Architect to address issues found. 
 * **Tools:** `EngineDoc` (in this even needed?)
 * **Instructions:** "Assess the FIP against the description of the requested feature. Make a critical assessment that the FIP contains complete and sufficient context such that a human and GitHub Copilot developer team could implement the feature such that it would meet the description of the feature request. Are all aspects of the feature request addressed in the FIP? Provide an output judgement of PASS or FAIL. If the FIP fails judgement, provide a description of the errors for the Technical Archtect to address."

## **`FeaturePackageVerifier`** (a.k.a. Feasibility & Architectural Analyst)
 * **Type:** Agent with tools
 * **Role:** Ensure the implementation plan described in the FIP is technically feasible and can realistically be implemented in the game codebase.
 * **Input:** FIP
 * **Output:** FIP approval status (PASS | FAIL), suggestions to the Technical Architect to address issues found. 
 * **Tools:** `EngineDoc`, `EngineAPI`, `EngineCode`, `ProjectContextManager`
 * **Instructions:** "Assess the FIP against the technical documentation and references, as well as the game project codebase. Make a critical assessment of whehter or not the FIP can be realistically implemented as described. Assess the implementation plan for efficiency as well, and ensure that the feature implementation is not excessively complicated or brittle. Provide an output judgement of PASS or FAIL. If the FIP fails judgement, provide a description of the errors for the Technical Archtect to address."

## **`FeatureImplementationValidator`** (a.k.a. API Contract Validator)
 * **Type:** Agent with tools
 * **Role:** To objectively verify that the human's commit to the game codebase fulfills the implementation description found in the FIP's API contract.
 * **Input:** The game codebase, the FIP that was implemented (or a reference to it)
 * **Output:** Boolean confirmation of whether or not the FIP has been implemented, mark as complete in the ADR.
 * **Tools:** A custom Python tool (`contract_checker`) using Tree-sitter.
 * **Instructions:** "You are an automated contract validator. Use your `contract_checker` tool to verify that every item in the FIP's 'API Contract' section has been implemented with the correct signature in the committed code."

## **`StateManager`**
 * **Type:** Manager
 * **Role:** Manage the flow of work through the graph of AFIE.
 * **Input:**
 * **Output:**
 * **Tools:**
 * **Instructions:**
