      "## System Overview\n",
      "This system provides a comprehensive framework for managing Non-Player Character (NPC) dialogue within the game. It enables players to engage in branching conversations, with dialogue options dynamically influenced by game state, player attributes, and past interactions, fostering a more immersive and responsive narrative experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Core Components\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **DialogueManager**\n",
      "    *   **Purpose:** Orchestrates the entire dialogue system, managing the loading, parsing, and execution of conversation trees. It acts as the central hub for all dialogue-related operations.\n",
      "    *   **Key Methods:**\n",
      "        *   `startConversation(npcId, player)`: Initiates a conversation with a specific NPC.\n",
      "        *   `getCurrentDialogueNode()`: Returns the currently displayed dialogue node.\n",
      "        *   `selectPlayerChoice(choiceIndex)`: Processes the player's selected dialogue choice.\n",
      "        *   `advanceDialogue()`: Moves to the next dialogue node based on player input or automatic progression.\n",
      "        *   `endConversation()`: Closes the dialogue interface and cleans up active conversation data.\n",
      "        *   `loadConversationData(npcId)`: Loads dialogue content for a given NPC.\n",
      "        *   `validateConversationTree(conversationData)`: Checks for structural integrity and valid references.\n",
      "    *   **Data Structures:**\n",
      "        *   `activeConversation`: A table holding the current conversation's state, including `npcId`, `currentNodeId`, `conversationHistory` (e.g., a list of visited node IDs), and `npcMemory` (e.g., a table of flags or relationship values).\n",
      "        *   `conversationDataCache`: A table storing loaded conversation trees, keyed by `npcId`.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **DialogueParser**\n",
      "    *   **Purpose:** Responsible for loading and parsing dialogue content from external files (JSON/XML), validating its structure, and converting it into an internal, usable format.\n",
      "    *   **Key Methods:**\n",
      "        *   `parseFile(filePath)`: Reads and parses dialogue data from a specified file.\n",
      "        *   `validateStructure(data)`: Performs checks for required fields, valid node IDs, and branching logic.\n",
      "        *   `buildConversationTree(parsedData)`: Organizes parsed data into a traversable tree structure.\n",
      "    *   **Data Structures:**\n",
      "        *   `ConversationNode`: A table representing a single dialogue segment, containing:\n",
      "            *   `id`: Unique identifier for the node.\n",
      "            *   `speaker`: The NPC speaking (e.g., `npcId` or a specific character name).\n",
      "            *   `portrait`: Path to the speaker's portrait image.\n",
      "            *   `text`: The dialogue text.\n",

      "\n",
      "## Component Interactions\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Player Interaction:** The `NPCInteractionTrigger` continuously monitors the player's position relative to NPCs. When the player enters the `interactionRange` of an NPC, it displays an interaction prompt.\n",
      "2.  **Initiating Conversation:** When the player presses the interaction key while near an NPC, the `NPCInteractionTrigger` signals the `DialogueManager` to start a conversation with that specific NPC.\n",
      "3.  **Loading Dialogue:** The `DialogueManager` requests the dialogue data for the NPC from the `DialogueParser`. If the data is not cached, the `DialogueParser` loads and parses the relevant external content file. The `DialogueParser` validates the structure and returns a `ConversationTree` to the `DialogueManager`.\n",
      "4.  **Displaying Dialogue:** The `DialogueManager` sets the initial `currentNodeId` and calls `DialogueUI.showDialogueWindow()` with the data for the current node.\n",
      "5.  **Text Animation:** The `DialogueUI` handles the text reveal animation, using a configurable speed. It also displays the speaker's portrait and name.\n",
      "6.  **Player Choice Selection:** If the current node has player choices, `DialogueUI` displays them. When the player selects a choice (via keyboard or mouse), `DialogueUI` passes the choice index to the `DialogueManager`.\n",
      "7.  **Processing Choices:** The `DialogueManager` retrieves the selected choice's data. It then uses the `ConditionEvaluator` to check if the choice is currently available based on game state. If available, it executes any associated `ConsequenceHandler` actions and determines the `next_node_id`.\n",
      "8.  **Advancing Conversation:** The `DialogueManager` updates its `currentNodeId` and calls `DialogueUI.showDialogueWindow()` with the data for the new node. This process repeats until a terminal node is reached or the player chooses to exit.\n",
      "9.  **Exiting Conversation:** The player can exit by selecting a \"Goodbye\" option or pressing ESC. The `DialogueUI` captures this input and informs the `DialogueManager`, which then calls `DialogueUI.hideDialogueWindow()` and cleans up `activeConversation` data.\n",
      "10. **NPC Memory & State:** The `ConditionEvaluator` and `ConsequenceHandler` interact with external systems (Quest System, Inventory System, Player Stats, Game State) and the `activeConversation.npcMemory` to check conditions and apply consequences.\n",
