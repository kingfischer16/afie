      "## System Overview\n",
      "The Player Inventory System manages all items a player collects and possesses, providing functionality for item storage, organization, and interaction. It supports various item types, including consumables and equipment, with a user-friendly interface for players to manage their virtual belongings.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Core Components\n",
      "\n",
      "### Inventory Manager\n",
      "*   **Purpose:** Acts as the central authority for all inventory data, managing item storage, stacking, sorting, filtering, and persistence.\n",
      "*   **Key Methods:**\n",
      "    *   `addItem(itemID, quantity)`: Adds an item to the inventory, handling stacking and finding available slots.\n",
      "    *   `removeItem(slotIndex, quantity)`: Removes a specified quantity of an item from a given slot.\n",
      "    *   `moveItem(fromSlotIndex, toSlotIndex)`: Swaps or moves items between inventory slots, respecting stacking rules.\n",
      "    *   `sortInventory(sortCriteria)`: Arranges items in the inventory based on predefined criteria (type, name, etc.).\n",
      "    *   `filterInventory(filterText)`: Filters the displayed inventory items based on a search string.\n",
      "    *   `saveInventory()`: Serializes the current inventory state for persistence.\n",
      "    *   `loadInventory(savedData)`: Deserializes inventory state from saved data.\n",
      "    *   `equipItem(slotIndex)`: Moves an item from an inventory slot to an equipped slot, handling unequip if necessary.\n",
      "    *   `unequipItem(equipSlot)`: Moves an item from an equipped slot back to an inventory slot.\n",
      "*   **Data Structures:**\n",
      "    *   `inventorySlots`: A table representing the 20 inventory slots (4x5 grid). Each slot can hold an `itemInstance` or be `nil`.\n",
      "        *   `inventorySlots[slotIndex] = { itemID = string, quantity = number }`\n",
      "    *   `itemDatabase`: A table containing definitions for all possible item types in the game, loaded from external data.\n",
      "        *   `itemDatabase[itemID] = { id = string, name = string, type = string, description = string, iconPath = string, maxStack = number, isQuestItem = boolean, equipSlot = string, stats = table, value = number }`\n",
      "    *   `equippedItems`: A table storing currently equipped items, keyed by their equipment slot (e.g., \"weapon\", \"armor\").\n",
      "        *   `equippedItems = { weapon = itemInstance, armor = itemInstance, accessory = itemInstance }`\n",
      "        *   `itemInstance = { itemID = string, quantity = number }`\n",
      "\n",
      "### Inventory UI\n",
      "*   **Purpose:** Renders the visual representation of the inventory and equipment slots, and handles user interactions with these visual elements.\n",
      "*   **Key Methods:**\n",
      "    *   `draw(inventoryData, equippedItems)`: Renders the inventory grid, item icons, quantities, and equipped item slots.\n",
      "    *   `showTooltip(itemInstance, slotIndex)`: Displays detailed information when hovering over an item.\n",
      "    *   `hideTooltip()`: Hides the currently displayed tooltip.\n",
      "    *   `handleMouseInput(event)`: Processes mouse events (clicks, movement) for inventory interactions like drag-and-drop and context menu activation.\n",
      "    *   `handleKeyInput(event)`: Processes key presses for actions like opening/closing the inventory or triggering sorting/filtering.\n",
      "    *   `showContextMenu(itemInstance, slotIndex)`: Displays a context menu for item actions.\n",
      "    *   `hideContextMenu()`: Hides the context menu.\n",
      "*   **Data Structures:**\n",
      "    *   `uiState`: Table to manage UI states like whether the inventory window is open, tooltip visibility, and context menu data.\n",
      "        *   `uiState = { isOpen = boolean, hoveredSlotIndex = number, draggedItemInstance = itemInstance, draggedFromSlotIndex = number, contextMenuData = { itemInstance = itemInstance, slotIndex = number } }`\n",
      "    *   `slotRenderData`: A table mapping inventory slot indices to their screen coordinates and visual properties for rendering.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Item Interaction Handler\n",
      "*   **Purpose:** Executes the game logic for item actions initiated by the player, such as using, dropping, equipping, and unequipping.\n",
      "*   **Key Methods:**\n",
      "    *   `useItem(itemInstance, slotIndex)`: Applies the effect of a consumable item and requests its removal from the inventory.\n",
      "    *   `dropItem(itemInstance, slotIndex, worldPosition)`: Requests removal of an item from inventory and signals the game world to spawn it.\n",
      "    *   `equipItem(itemInstance, slotIndex)`: Requests equipping an item, which involves moving it to `equippedItems` and updating player stats.\n",
      "    *   `unequipItem(equipSlot)`: Requests unequipping an item from a specific slot, returning it to the inventory.\n",
      "*   **Data Structures:**\n",
      "    *   Manages temporary state related to ongoing item interactions, such as the item currently being dragged.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Component Interactions\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **User Input:** The global `Input Handler` detects player input (e.g., 'I' key press, mouse clicks, mouse movement).\n",
      "2.  **Inventory Activation:** The `Input Handler` sends an event to the `Inventory UI` to toggle its `uiState.isOpen` state.\n",
      "3.  **Inventory Display:** When `uiState.isOpen` is true, the `Inventory UI` requests the current `inventorySlots` and `equippedItems` data from the `Inventory Manager` to render the UI.\n",
      "4.  **UI Interaction:**\n",
      "    *   **Hovering:** Mouse movement over an inventory slot or equipped item triggers the `Inventory UI` to call `showTooltip` or `hideTooltip` on itself, passing the relevant `itemInstance` and `slotIndex` obtained from the `Inventory Manager`.\n",
      "    *   **Clicking:** A mouse click within an inventory slot or on an equipped item is handled by the `Inventory UI`.\n",
      "        *   **Drag & Drop:** If a click starts a drag, the `Inventory UI` records the `draggedItemInstance` and `draggedFromSlotIndex` in its `uiState`. When the mouse is released over a valid slot, the `Inventory UI` calls `inventoryManager:moveItem(draggedFromSlotIndex, targetSlotIndex)`.\n",
      "        *   **Context Menu:** A right-click on an item triggers the `Inventory UI` to display a context menu, storing the `itemInstance` and `slotIndex` in its `uiState`.\n",
      "5.  **Action Execution:**\n",
      "    *   When a player selects an action from the context menu (e.g., \"Use\", \"Drop\", \"Equip\"), the `Inventory UI` calls the corresponding method on the `Item Interaction Handler`, passing the `itemInstance` and `slotIndex`.\n",
      "    *   The `Item Interaction Handler` then:\n",
      "        *   **Use:** Calls `inventoryManager:removeItem(slotIndex, 1)` and then signals the `Player Stats System` to apply the item's effect.\n",
      "        *   **Drop:** Calls `inventoryManager:removeItem(slotIndex, quantity)` and then signals the `Game World` to spawn the dropped item at the player's location.\n",
      "        *   **Equip:** Calls `inventoryManager:equipItem(slotIndex)`. This method internally handles moving the item to `equippedItems` and then signals the `Player Stats System` to apply stat modifications.\n",
      "        *   **Unequip:** Calls `inventoryManager:unequipItem(equipSlot)`. This method internally handles moving the item back to an inventory slot and signals the `Player Stats System` to remove stat modifications.\n",
      "6.  **Item Pickup:** The `Game World` detects player proximity to an item in the world. It then calls `inventoryManager:addItem(itemID, quantity)` and signals the `Game World` to remove the item from its state.\n",
      "7.  **Sorting/Filtering:** The `Inventory UI` receives input for sorting or filtering and calls `inventoryManager:sortInventory()` or `inventoryManager:filterInventory()`. The `Inventory Manager` returns the modified `inventorySlots` data, which the `Inventory UI` then uses to re-render.\n",
      "8.  **Persistence:** The global `Save/Load System` triggers `inventoryManager:saveInventory()` during game saves and `inventoryManager:loadInventory(savedData)` during game loads.\n",

      "*   **Player Stats System:**\n",
      "    *   When an item is equipped or unequipped, the `Item Interaction Handler` (via `Inventory Manager`) calls methods on the `Player Stats System` (e.g., `playerStats:applyStatModifier(statName, value)` or `playerStats:removeStatModifier(statName, value)`).\n",

      "*   **Input Handling:**\n",
      "    *   The main `Input Handler` dispatches relevant input events (key presses, mouse clicks, mouse movement) to the `Inventory UI` when the inventory is active.\n",
