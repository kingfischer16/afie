      "        *   `moveItem(fromSlot, toSlot)`: Swaps items between two slots.\n",
      "        *   `sortInventory()`: Sorts items based on predefined criteria.\n",
      "        *   `filterInventory(query)`: Filters items based on a search query.\n",
      "        *   `saveInventory()`: Serializes and saves the current inventory state.\n",
      "        *   `loadInventory(savedData)`: Deserializes and loads inventory state.\n",
      "        *   `getItemInSlot(slotIndex)`: Retrieves the item data for a given slot.\n",
      "        *   `findEmptySlot()`: Locates the next available empty slot.\n",
      "    *   **Data Structures:**\n",
      "        *   `inventorySlots`: A table representing the 20 inventory slots. Each slot can be `nil` or contain a table with:\n",
      "            *   `itemData`: Reference to the item's definition (from `ItemDatabase`).\n",
      "            *   `quantity`: The current quantity of the item in the slot (for stackable items).\n",
      "        *   `equippedItems`: A table mapping equipment slot types (e.g., \"weapon\", \"armor\") to the `itemData` and `quantity` of the equipped item.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **ItemDatabase**\n",
      "    *   **Purpose:** Stores definitions for all possible items in the game.\n",

      "        *   `getItemDefinition(itemID)`: Retrieves the full definition of an item by its ID.\n",
      "        *   `getAllItemDefinitions()`: Returns all item definitions.\n",
      "    *   **Data Structures:**\n",
      "        *   `items`: A table where keys are item IDs and values are tables containing item properties:\n",
      "            *   `id`: Unique item identifier.\n",
      "            *   `name`: Display name of the item.\n",

      "            *   `icon`: Path to the item's icon asset.\n",
      "            *   `type`: \"consumable\", \"equipment\", \"quest\", \"material\".\n",
      "            *   `stackable`: Boolean, true if the item can stack.\n",
      "            *   `maxStack`: Maximum quantity for stackable items (default 99).\n",
      "            *   `useEffect`: Function or identifier for consumable effects.\n",
      "            *   `equipmentSlot`: For equipment, the slot it occupies (e.g., \"weapon\", \"chest\").\n",
      "            *   `statsModifier`: For equipment, a table of stat changes (e.g., `{ health = 10, damage = 5 }`).\n",
      "            *   `isQuestItem`: Boolean, true for quest items.\n",
      "            *   `value`: Gold value for trading.\n",
      "            *   `craftingMaterials`: For materials, a list of associated crafting recipes or uses.\n",
